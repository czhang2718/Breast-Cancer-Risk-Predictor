# BC risk predictor
[This website](https://bcriskcalc.netlify.app/) allows you to predicts a woman's risk of breast cancer within one year. 
## Purpose
Breast cancer is the most common cancer for women in the United States as one in eight US women develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime. Accurate assessment of a womanâ€™s risk of developing breast cancer is essential for making correct medical decisions and recommendations such as lifestyle changes and medical interventions. This risk calculator is intended for women aged 35-87 who have recently had a screening mammogram, as well as their physicians. The calculation is based on logistic regression models developed by William Barlow and others and published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The models require information about age group, breast density (from the screening mammography), previous breast procedures, first-degree family history of breast cancer, and some additional information for post-menopausal women. There are separate prediction models for premenopausal and postmenopausal women. The models were estimated from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, which had 2.3 million mammograms for about one million women.
