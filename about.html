        <p style="text-indent: 40 px"> <img src="Mammography.jpg" width="25%" height=auto style="float: right;"></p>About 1 in 8 U.S. women develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetime.
          Mammograms allow for early detection of breast cancer and help determine which lifestyle changes can lower one&rsquo;s risk.
          In addition, a woman&rsquo;s risk of breast cancer is an important factor in determining what preventive measures to take.
          The purpose of this breast cancer risk calculator is to predict a woman&rsquo;s risk of breast cancer within one year.
        <!-- <p>The Gail model is a popular model used to calculate a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing invasive breast cancer
          within five years (JNCI 81:1879-1886, 1989) [link]. The model uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) [link]
          Program dataset of the US National Cancer Institute, gathered from women aged 35-74. However, the model does not make use of mammographic data even though it is intended for women undergoing screening mammograms..</p> -->
        <p>This calculator&rsquo;s predictions are based on a logistic regression model developed by Barlow et al. (JNCI 98:1204-1214, 2006)
          using data from the <a href="https://www.bcsc-research.org/">Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium</a>. The model requires information about age group, breast density
          (from the screening mammography), previous breast procedures, first-degree family history of breast cancer, and &ndash;
          for post-menopausal women only &ndash; race/ethnicity, body mass index, age at birth of first child, current use of hormone therapy,
          surgical menopause, and previous mammographic outcome. There are separate prediction models for premenopausal and postmenopausal women.</p>
        <p><img src="ROC.png" width="50%" height=auto style="float: left;">The Barlow model has been evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
          The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a commonly used statistical measure for evaluating and comparing prediction models.
          A useless prediction model (i.e., a random guess) would have an AUC of 0.5. The AUC of the Barlow model is estimated to be
          approximately .622 (for both pre- and post-menopausal women), which is significantly higher than 0.5.&nbsp;
